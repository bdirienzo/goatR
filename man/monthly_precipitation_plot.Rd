\usage{
monthly_precipitation_plot(
  ...,
  colors = NULL,
  title = "Accumulated Precipitation by Month"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more data frames, each containing data for a weather station. Each data frame must include the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \strong{fecha} Date of the precipitation measurement. Should be in a format coercible to \code{Date}.
\item \strong{id} Identifier for the weather station.
\item \strong{precipitacion_pluviometrica} Numeric value representing the precipitation in millimeters.
}

You can pass multiple data frames separated by commas, e.g., "station1", "station2", "station3"}

\item{colors}{Optional. A character vector specifying the colors to use for each station in the plot. If not provided, the function will generate a set of dark colors automatically. The vector should either be named with station IDs or have a length matching the number of stations.}

\item{title}{Optional. A string specifying the title of the plot. Defaults to \code{"Accumulated Precipitation by Month"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object representing the total monthly precipitation for each station.
}
\description{
Generates a bar plot illustrating the total monthly precipitation across multiple weather stations.
}
\details{
This function accepts one or more data frames, each representing data from a different weather station. It aggregates the monthly precipitation data and visualizes it using a grouped bar chart. Users can customize the plot colors and title as needed.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming you have two data frames: station1 and station2
plot <- monthly_precipitation_plot(station1, station2, title = "Monthly Precipitation")
print(plot)
