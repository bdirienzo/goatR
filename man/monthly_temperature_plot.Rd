\title{Generate a Monthly Average Temperature Plot for Multiple Stations}
\usage{
monthly_temperature_plot(..., colors = NULL, title = "Temperature")
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more data frames, each containing data for a weather station. Each data frame must include the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \strong{fecha}: Date column (\code{Date} or character) representing the date of the observation.
\item \strong{id}: Character or factor column serving as a unique identifier for the weather station.
\item \strong{temperatura_abrigo_150cm}: Numeric column representing the temperature measurement at 150 cm height.
}

You can pass multiple data frames separated by commas, e.g., \code{station1}, \code{station2}, \code{station3}.}

\item{colors}{A named vector specifying the colors to use for each station in the plot. The names should correspond to station IDs. If \code{NULL}, a set of dark colors will be generated automatically.}

\item{title}{The title of the plot. Defaults to \code{"Temperature"} if not specified.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object representing the monthly average temperature plot.
}
\description{
This function creates a line plot showing the monthly average of temperature measurements (\code{temperatura_abrigo_150cm}) for multiple Argentine weather stations.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Validates that all inputs are data frames and contain the required columns.
\item Converts the \code{fecha} column to \code{Date} type if necessary.
\item Extracts the month from the \code{fecha} column and orders it according to the calendar.
\item Calculates the monthly average temperature for each station.
\item Generates a line plot with points, coloring each station differently.
}

\strong{RECOMENDATION:} Use this function in conjunction with our other functions available at @seealso
