\usage{
temperature_summary_table(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Data frames representing temperature data for various stations. Each data frame should contain a column named "id" representing station identifiers, and a column named "temperatura_abrigo_150cm" representing temperature measurements at 150 cm height.}
}
\value{
A data frame summarizing the temperature statistics for each station, including average temperature, maximum and minimum temperature, standard deviation, and total number of days.
}
\description{
This function generates a summary table of temperature data from multiple stations.
}
\details{
The function combines the input data frames into a single data frame, validates the required columns, and then groups the data by station ID to compute the desired summary statistics. The required columns are "id" and "temperatura_abrigo_150cm". If any of the input data frames are missing these columns, an error will be thrown.
