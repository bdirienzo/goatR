\title{Generate Temperature Summary Table for a Weather Station}
\format{
An object of class \code{data.frame} with 12 rows and 3 columns.
}
\usage{
station1
}
\arguments{
\item{station_id}{Character. The unique identifier of the weather station (e.g., "NH0472").}

\item{path}{Character. Path to the folder containing the CSV datasets. Defaults to "datasets-raw/".}
}
\value{
A data frame with summary statistics for the specified weather station, including:
\describe{
\item{average_temperature}{Numeric. The average temperature recorded at 150 cm height.}
\item{max_temperature}{Numeric. The maximum temperature recorded at 150 cm height.}
\item{min_temperature}{Numeric. The minimum temperature recorded at 150 cm height.}
\item{standard_deviation}{Numeric. The standard deviation of the temperature recorded at 150 cm height.}
\item{total_days}{Integer. The total number of observations used for calculating the summary statistics.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates summary statistics for temperature data from a specific weather station.
It reads a CSV file containing weather data, filters it by station ID, and returns the average, maximum,
minimum temperature, standard deviation, and total number of observations.
